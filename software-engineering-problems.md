    - Finding documentation and example code
    - Debugging and reading other peoples code
        - Debugging broken logic
            1. Locate the entrypoint of the program
            1. Track down the flow of the program function by function
            1. Add ```Serial.println()``` to see where the code fails
        - Debugging error messages
            1. Locating the error message in the stacktrace
            1. Considering whether the error might be caused by a different line than the error message suggests
            1. Googling the error
            1. Recognizing what solutions may look like
                - Typically in the form of a question at the top of a forum post, where the useful info is usually branded as "solution" or upvoted by many.
                - Recognizing what solutions do not look like so time is not wasted
                - Skimming through the solution to see if it makes sense
    - Following style guides and conventions
        - Setting expectations for what different code looks like
            - Easier to make assumptions to save time
            - Being able to trust variable and function names and naming schemes to inform about what the code does
    - Code splitting
        - Function names should in most cases be enough to understand what the code does
            - If not, split the function into smaller functions
    - Solving one problem at the time
        - Demonstrate conplex problems that are not possible to solve for a novice without practicing this principle
    - Testing code early and thoroughly
        - Ensure one has a solid foundation before continuing, to avoid having to go back and fix bugs later in a more complex system.
- Architecture
    - Structs
        - What they should learn
            - Why use structs?
            - [How to use structs for grouping variables and functions](https://github.com/nosknut/arduino-course-v2023/blob/main/IELET1002/02_02_2023/Exercises/1c/1c.ino#L1C1-L19)
            - When not to use structs
                - Highly interconnected code
        - What they should **not** learn
            - The term "Object Oriented Programming"
            - Constructors
            - Member visibility (Private and Public)
            - Inheritance
            - Overriding
            - Overloading
            - These concepts make up all the complexity of OOP, as well as all the pitfalls. They will not be needed in this course.
    - Creating functions that update globals, instead of returning the result
        - This makes the code more scalable (Mostly applies to the Arduino framework)
    - Subdividing problems and creating isolated systems to deal with them one by one
